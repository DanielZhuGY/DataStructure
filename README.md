## Introduction

**Systematic Strategy for solving a problem.**

-Clearly state the problem. **Identify the input and Output formats**.

-Try to come up with some example inputs and outputs. And try to cover all edge cases.

-Come up with correct solution for the problem. State it in plaint English.

-Implement the solution by testing with the example inputs and outputs. Fix bugs, if any.

-Analysis the algorithm's complexity and identify inefficiency, if any.

-Apply appropriate technique to solve inefficiency. And repeat Step 3 to Step 6.

## Lecture 1 --Binary Search & Complexity

Problem: We have a list of number ascending order. And we want to write an algorithm to find out the index of a specific number in the list. If the number is not in the list, the algorithm return **-1**. Otherwise, return the index of the number.

Here are some cases we state on the list.

1. A standard ascending order list.

2. Only one element in the list.

3. An empty list.

4. The query is at the beginning.

5. The query is at the end.

6. We got repeated number on the list.

7. The target number is not in the list.

A validation testing code is packed.
